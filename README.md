# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack dynamic Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform developed using PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application allows Customers, Vendors, and Administrators to interact through dedicated panels and role-based access control. All products, categories, banners, coupons, orders, and featured sections are dynamically managed through the database.

The project is inspired by modern e-commerce platforms and follows a database-driven architecture with authentication, vendor management, analytics, product variations, API endpoints, and security best practices.
